The information is filled in based on the corresponding report.\nIn addition, the documents have encryption data that can help to sort the text of the reports.\nWhen you receive the report and fill out the article, you will be able to check the correctness of the task. In case of incorrectness, the user should correct the errors and repeat the check.
